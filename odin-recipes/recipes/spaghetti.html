    <p>This is a simple recipe for delicious spaghetti aglio e olio.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
        <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Combine garlic and olive oil in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Stir red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt into the pasta. Pour in olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; stir until combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</p>
